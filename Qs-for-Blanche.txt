- is it ok to put the webkit-font-smoothing on the html element generally, rather than associated with a particular element?
-is cursor: pointer really necessary to specify a hand for a link? seems automatic already
- what is a CDN exactly? when should you use it? (on the site i just built i included the FontAwesome fonts in the directory on the server rather than pointing to MAxCDN...)
- when to use Network tab in Chrome tools... just to see if a file has loaded?

- trouble making perfect circles in CSS (was adapting to content width)
- also, I had used spans instead of a list, guess that would be better?
